1.Create a Date class with data int year, int month, int date,  int hrs, int min, int sec. Create a default, no-argument constructor which sets the default date to January 1, 2000, 00:00:00 Create 3 overloaded setter methods 
    void setDate(int year, int month, int date)
    void setDate(int year, int month, int date, int hrs, int min)
    void setDate(int year, int month, int date, int hrs, int min, int sec)
    Also write a displayDate() method which will display the date depending on the type of date object created.





2.Given a class Line with slope, y-intercept, x1, y1, x2, y2 as  attributes, write 3 constructors for equations for the line given Slope-y-intercept, Slope Point and two Point forms
    Slope-y-intercept:
    y = mx + c
    Slope point form:
    y - y1 = m(x - x1)
    Two Point form:
    (y - y1) / (y1 - y2) = m(x - x1) / (x1 - x2)
    Also, m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    Each constructor should display the appropriate Line equation.







3.Create a Test class with a data double base, int power, int logBase, int argument. 
    Create a default, no-argument constructor which sets the default value of all variables to 2.
    There are 2 overloaded functions:
    1. double calculate (double base, int power)
    This function returns the value when *base* is raised to *power*
    For example: calculate (3.0, 2) returns the value of 3.0 raised to 2 i.e., 9.0
    2. double calculate (int logBase, int argument)
    This function returns the value of the log of *argument* to the base *logBase*.
    For example: calculate (3, 9) returns log of 9 to the base 3 i.e., 2.0
    Create a main method in a separate class to call the above functions with the following inputs:
    1. calculate (2, 4)
    2. calculate (2.0, 4)
    Create a display() method which displays the output based on the type of Test object created.





4.Write a menu-driven program to recruit an employee (depending on his performance in various rounds) in some software company using constructor overloading.
    Selection Criteria for each post is given below:
    i) Programmer (Minimum total of 80 marks):-

    Rounds:-
    (1) Technical Test
    (2) Interview
    iii) Project Manager (Minimum score 90 marks)
    Rounds:-
    (1) Interview

    Create a class Posting and write 3 constructors to initialize the object and set the parameters
    and display the employee post according to selection criteria.
    Data members:
    ● int courseWork;
