8. Program on Abstraction: Implement a Program to demonstrate multiple
Inheritance using Interfaces



A. Consider two interfaces, Volume and SurfaceArea with methods getVolume() and
    getSurfaceArea() respectively. Class ‘Cylinder’ implements both Volume and
    SurfaceArea and implements their methods. The class contains their required dimensions
    as data members. Write a program which inputs its dimensions and prints its volume and
    surface area. Create classes ‘Cone’and ‘Sphere’ that implements both the interfaces. In
    main class, ask user which shape volume and area needs to be calculated. Use switch
    case.
B. A banking system has two interfaces SavingAccount and CurrentAccount. The
    SavingAccount account has method getSimpleInterest() and CurrentAccont has method
    getCompoudInterest(). Both these interfaces are implemented by class Customer.
    Customer have data members: account type, interest rate and balance. The class then
    calculates interest on balance and prints it.
C. A fast food centre has two interfaces EatItHere and TakeAway. They have methods like
    deliverOrder() and dispatchOrder(). the class Consumer inherits both of them. If
    Consumer orders a takeaway he will be charged a convenience fee of Rs. 45/- or 5% of
    order price whichever is more. If he chooses to eat in a restaurant then he will be charged
    Rs. 500/- service charge or 10% of order price whichever is lower. The class consumer
    has data members as order number and order price.
D. Write a Java program to create an interface Sortable with a method sort()
    that sorts an array of integers in ascending order. Create two classes
    BubbleSort and SelectionSort that implement the Sortable interface and
    provide their own implementations of the sort() method.
E. Write a class that implements the CharSequence interface. Your
    implementation should return the string backwards. Select one of the
    sentences to use as the data. Write a small main method to test your
    class.
