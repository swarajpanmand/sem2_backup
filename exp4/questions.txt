1.Exercise GradesStatistics : Write a program called GradesStatistics, which reads in n grades (of int between 0 and 10, inclusive) and displays the average, minimum, maximum, median and standard deviation. Display the floating-point values upto 2 decimal places.  Your output shall look like:
    Enter the number of students : 4
    Enter the grade for students 1 : 50
    Enter the grade for students 1 : 51
    Enter the grade for students 1 : 56
    Enter the grade for students 1 : 53
    {50,51,56,53}
    The average is 52.50
    The Minimum is 50
    The Maximum is 56
    The Median is : 52.00
    Note: 1) The std. deviation is 2.29(formula can be referred from net)

2.Book Ratings : Write a program to find the most popular book. Create a 2D array named bookRating which should hold ratings( 1 to 5) of a few books. Collect ratings of n such books. a)Find the average rating of each book. b) Display the most popular book. i.e. a Book with highest average rating.

    Your country is at war and your enemies are using a secret code to communicate with each other. You have managed to intercept a message that reads as follows:
    :mmZ\dxZmx]Zpgy
    The message is obviously encrypted using the enemy’s secret code. You have just learned that their encryption method is based upon the ASCII code.
    For example, the letter “A” is encoded using the number 65 and “B” is encoded using the number 66.
    Your enemy’s secret code takes each letter of the message and encrypts it
    as follows:
    If (OriginalChar + Key > 126) then
    EncryptedChar = 32 + ((OriginalChar + Key) – 127)
    Else
    EncryptedChar = (OriginalChar + Key)
    For example, if the enemy uses Key = 10 then the message “Hey” would be
    encrypted as:
    Character ASCII code
    ______________________
    H 72
    e 101
    y 121
    Encrypted H = (72 + 10) = 82 = R in ASCII
    Encrypted e = (101 + 10) = 111 = o in ASCII
    Encrypted y = 32 + ((121 + 10) – 127) = 36 = $ in ASCII
    Consequently, “Hey” would be transmitted as “Ro$.”
    Write a program that decrypts the intercepted message. You only know that the key used is a number between 1 and 100. Your program should try to decode the message using all possible keys between 1 and 100.
    When you try the valid key, the message will make sense. For all other keys, the message will appear as gibberish.
    Write a program in Java to maintain the information of Movies which includes the information of name of movie , type of movie( action , thriller , comedy ,drama ) , Hero name , Heroine , budget in Rs. . Write a program to accept the information of movies from user and sort them according to the budget of the film.
