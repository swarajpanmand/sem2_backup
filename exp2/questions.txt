Experiment No. 2: Constructor
Aim: Write a program to demonstrate constructor

Problem Statements:
    1. Create a class doctor with name,degree,spdegree and acheivement. The class
    contains a display function to display the values. A parameterized constructor should
    be included in your program. Use user given input for the same.

    2. Time class : Hours, Minutes and Seconds
        Write a program that asks the user to enter seconds as integer. The program
        should compute and display the number of hours, number of minutes and number
        of seconds in that seconds.
        For example if user enters 4205 seconds as a input called totSeconds. The answer
        should be
        Hours : 1
        Minutes : 10
        Seconds : 5
        These calculations can be done in a method name: conversion1() which will also
        display the result as Hour,minutes and seconds.
        Similarly- if user input is Hour, Minute and Second then write another method
        conversion2() which will have these three parameters and the conversion2 method
        will compute and display the totSeconds.
        Note - Use any class (ie scanner /BufferedReader class) for input through console
        as hour/min/seconds/totSeconds
        
    3. Create a class Hospital, assume appropriete data members. Create a default constructor and
    provide appropriete get and set methods for the data members.

    4. Create a class Vehicle. Assume appropriete data members. Demonstrate default constructor and
    parameterised constructor for the data members.

    5. Create a class Event. Assume appropriete data members. Demonstrate menu driven program to
    invoke default constructor, parameterised constructor and copy constructor for the data members.
